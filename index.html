			 <h3>
				<p> ADR Candelon (ADRC) is based in Shoreham, Sussex and was established in June 2013. The company owns the controlling share of BCAL (Brighton City Airport Ltd) and AAM (Apollo Aviation Maintanence). The owners of ADRC also own a controlling stake in FTA (a pilot training school or FTO), though directly and not through ADRC. </p>
				<br> </br>
				<p> ADRC consists of a specialist aviation services portfolio, including an FTO, an airport and airside operations management, as well as an aircraft maintenance company. The directors of ADRC hail from a pure aviation background, with wide ranging experience; including flight instruction, directorships at an FTO and from management positions in the air cargo services and freight forwarding sectors. </p>
				<br> </br>
				<p> ADRC was formed to encompass and provide a more formal structure for the aviation companies in the group. The directors have mutual interest in the various companies, which now benefit from enhanced supplier and client relationships across the group as a whole. ADRC is dedicated to managing and controlling and maximising profits across the companies in the group, with Apollo Aviation as the most recent acquisition. The directors at ADR Candelon have innovative and ambitious expansion plans for the group, with focus on development of all companies and personnel within the group, which currently employs around 70 staff, with a projected turnover of Â£5 million for 2015. </p>
